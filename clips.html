  <h1>My Work</h1>
      <p>During my time at Mizzou, I have written for two local publications. The first position, starring my less-refined work,<br>
        was at the Boone County Journal, based in Ashland, Missouri.<br>
        The owner of the paper hired me as a summer reporter in 2020 and I wrote several articles until the start of the school year.<br>
        In the summer of 2021, I took a class at Mizzou that allowed me to write as a beat reporter for the Columbia Missourian. This was much more like an unpaid intership than a class.<br>
        I worked from 9-5, 5 days a week reporting on the daily news for the Missourian. I wrote thirty articles during my time with the Missourian and became a much better writer.</p>
        <h3>Below you'll find a sample of my work for both the Columbia Missourian and the Boone County Journal.</h3>

        <h2>"MU to cut 12 School of Medicine tenured faculty salaries by 10%-25%"</h2>
        <h3>"At least 12 tenured faculty in MU’s School of Medicine will see salary cuts ranging from 10% to 25% starting Sept. 1 after recent productivity reviews.<br><br>
          MU spokesperson Christian Basi said the reviews started in early spring and were conducted over several weeks.<br><br>
          Productivity reviews are a common method of measuring the performance of tenured faculty, Basi said, but salary adjustment is a relatively new tool in that process. He said the reviews and cuts are ways MU holds itself accountable.<br><br>
          Some faculty in the School of Medicine and beyond disagree with the planned cuts and the reviews.<br><br>
          Dennis Lubahn, a professor of biochemistry appointed jointly to the School of Medicine and the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources, sent an email to MU faculty members declaring the cuts an “attack on tenure.” He said he hoped to make faculty aware of the issue.</h3>

            <h2>"Stepping back: Glascock sets sights on future as retirement nears"</h2>
            <h3>"The COVID-19 pandemic is a big part of the reason Columbia City Manager John Glascock decided to retire. As he worked to keep city government running while residents of Boone and surrounding counties were dying, he came to realize that "life is too short."<br><br>"I got to thinking all of the sudden, I'm not going to live forever," Glascock said in a recent interview.<br><br>
              Glascock's father died at 45 when Glascock was only a teenager. He didn't understand then how young that was. Glascock is now in his 60s and said the casualties of the pandemic<br>
              made him realize that work is not the most important thing in his life. He wants to spend more time with his wife, Kristin Gerber, and the rest of their family.<br><br>
              Gerber said her husband is a reflective person. She said his understanding of life's brevity is why he puts his "heart and soul" into everything he does.<br>
              Even in the face of the pandemic, she said, he got up every day for work and gave it his all.<br><br>
              Glascock announced last Thursday that he would retire effective Jan. 14, ending a 38-year career in public service during which he has evolved from a highway<br>
              engineer into a top-level administrator. Colleagues give him credit for diversifying leadership in city government, and he says he's learned how important building<br>
              relationships is to success in life. That's something his successor will need to do, he said, and he's hopeful about Columbia's future."</h3>

                Henry Wright's sister Deborah Wright said she and other family members had spent much of the previous night cooking in preparation for the fundraiser.<br>
                She said everyone worked together to cook the multiple dishes served Saturday.<br><br>
                They charged $8 for a plate, which included a main entrée, two sides, cornbread and a dessert. The entrée options were fried catfish or chicken, with <br>
                green beans, coleslaw and potato salad for the sides. Dessert consisted of bundt cake, peach cobbler and chocolate pie."</h3>

                <h3>"Black drivers continue to be pulled over at a disproportionate rate in Columbia and Boone County, according to data in the 2020 Missouri Vehicle Stops<br>
                  Report from the Missouri Attorney General’s Office.<br><br>
                  Black people make up 10.3 percent of Columbia’s driving-age population but were the subjects of 35.2 percent of Columbia Police Department traffic stops<br>
                  in 2020. That means Black drivers were pulled over 3.41 times as much as expected based on population. This number is marginally lower than the rate in 2019,<br>
                  which at 3.51 was the largest disparity index on record for the Police Department.<br><br>
                  In Boone County, Black drivers make up 8.4 percent of the driving population, but represented 26 percent of traffic stops. That’s nearly 3.1 times more stops<br>
                  than expected. That disparity rate was also down from a Sheriff’s Department high of 3.53 in 2019.<br><br>
                  The 2020 report showed a disparity index of 1.63 for traffic stops involving Black drivers among all law enforcement agencies in the state that submitted data.<br>
                  The annual report has been released by the Attorney General’s Office since 2000."</h3>

                  <h3>"Sanitary precautions, absentee voting, and new polling places are all measures being taken to protect elections this year, says Boone County Clerk Brianna Lennon.<br>
                    With the municipal April 7 election moved to June 2, the Clerks’ office is taking that time to prepare.<br><br>
                    One of the biggest changes happening is the switch in polling locations. Some polling locations are areas that see regular activity from those who have been deemed higher<br>
                    risk for severe illness, and as such will not be used in the coming election. The Clerk’s Office has worked with Southern Boone Schools and Columbia Public Schools to arrange<br>
                    the usage of school property for voting."</h3>

                      leading to a parking lot that is flanked by a tennis court and butterfly garden beds. There is also a restroom right by the parking lot.<br><br>

                      A small creek splits the two playgrounds, running through the entire park, starting in the woods on one end and ending in the woods on the other.<br>
                      There are three bridges for crossing the creek. The park also has a volleyball court, a large grassy field, a baseball diamond, and a small disc golf course.<br>
                      The entire park is surrounded by a track for runners and cyclists, and there are benches scattered throughout the area."</h3>
